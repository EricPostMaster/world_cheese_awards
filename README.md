# This is the world's cheesiest dataset. ðŸ§€

The [2021 World Cheese Awards website](https://worldcheeseawards.com/wca-results) lists the companies, cheese names, and rank of each of over 1,700 entries, but a lot of the extra sharp goodness is hidden in the filtering capability of the website. Holes like that belong in Swiss cheese, not datasets!

So I fixed it. And let me just say, you're gouda love it.

The dataset in this repo is the 2021 awards data with company, product name, rank, category, country, and county information. I'm sure you can find something fun to do with it. Whatever you do, please remember to stay cheesy.
